# DAVE

DAVE stands for Data Analysis of Variable Events, which is a GUI built on top of
the [Stingray library](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray). It is
intended to be used by astronomers for time-series analysis in general, and
analysis of variable sources in particular.

The goal is to enable scientific exploration of astronomical X-Ray
observations and to analyse this data in a graphical environment.


## Get Started

* Clone the project `$ git clone https://github.com/StingraySoftware/dave`
* Install a Python virtual env and a compatible version of node: `$ source setup/setup.bash`
* Run the application for development: `$ setup/run_gui.bash`
* Or run the build script for Linux_X64 `$ setup/build_linux-x64.bash` for getting the distributable at DAVE build folder.

You will see that there's plenty left to do!

NOTE: Mac OSX dependencies
* At least Homebrew installed (http://brew.sh/) or MacPorts installed (https://www.macports.org)
