# DAVE

DAVE stands for Data Analysis of Variable Events, which is a GUI built on top of
the [Stingray library](https://github.com/StingraySoftware/stingray). It is
intended to be used by astronomers for time-series analysis in general, and
analysis of variable sources in particular.

The goal is to enable scientific exploration and flexible analysis flows where
users can insert their own algorithms to compare the effects of such changes.

## Get Started

* Clone the project `$ git clone https://github.com/StingraySoftware/dave`
* Install a Python virtual env and a compatible version of node: `$ source src/main/resources/bash/setup_dev_env.bash`
* Run the application for development: `$ src/main/resources/bash/run_gui.bash`
* Or run the build script for Linux_X64 `$ src/main/resources/bash/build_dave.bash` for getting the distributable at DAVE build folder.

You will see that there's plenty left to do!
